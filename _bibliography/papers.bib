  abstract = {Denoising of magnetic resonance image (MRI) is a critical step in MRI image processing and analysis. With the advantage of not requiring paired noisy-clean images for training, self-supervised denoising methods are emerging as competitive alternatives to supervised denoising methods in MRI denoising. However, current self-supervised image denoising methods are not effective enough for MRI. In this work, we propose Noise2SR-M (N2SR-M), a self-supervised denoising method for MR images, which is more efficient for high-dimensional MR images. N2SR-M is designed for training with paired noisy data of different sizes divided from a single high-dimensional noisy input image. Our N2SR-M model is able to utilize the redundant information from the additional image dimension to generate noisy image pairs for the denoising task. With the combination of additional dimension constraint and the effectiveness of SR method based training image pair generation, our model is more efficient for denoising high-dimensional MR images. The quantitative and qualitative improvements in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging denoising task demonstrate that N2SRM successfully restores detailed image contents and removes tiny structural noise and artifacts from noise-corrupted high-dimensional MRI. Moreover, the denoised BOLD image also induces more efficient R2* image computation.},

  title={Noise2SR: Learning to Denoise from Super-Resolved Single Noisy Fluorescence Image},
  abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy is a key driver to promote discoveries of biomedical research. However, with the limitation of microscope hardware and characteristics of the observed samples, the fluorescence microscopy images are susceptible to noise. Recently, a few self-supervised deep learning (DL) denoising methods have been proposed. However, the training efficiency and denoising performance of existing methods are relatively low in real scene noise removal. To address this issue, this paper proposed self-supervised image denoising method Noise2SR (N2SR) to train a simple and effective image denoising model based on single noisy observation. Our Noise2SR denoising model is designed for training with paired noisy images of different dimensions. Benefiting from this training strategy, Noise2SR is more efficiently self-supervised and able to restore more image details from a single noisy observation. Experimental results of simulated noise and real microscopy noise removal show that Noise2SR outperforms two blind-spot based self-supervised deep learning image denoising methods. We envision that Noise2SR has the potential to improve more other kind of scientific imaging quality.},
