I am a 4-th year Ph.D. candicate in [SMILE Lab:smiley:](https://smilelab.com.cn) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn) (Shanghai, China), advised by Prof. [Yuyao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gIE0JTAAAAAJ&hl). Before that, I received my B.E. degree of Computer Science and Technology from Wuhan University of Technology in 2021.

I am dedicated to explore **solving medical inverse problems** within a scarce data and low SNR scenarios. Currently, my research focuses on:
* CT/MRI Undersampled Reconstruction <br>
* Motion Correction and Motion Tracking <br>
* Self-supervised Image Restoration <br>
* Diffusion Models
