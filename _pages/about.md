I am Lixuan Chen (陈利瑄 in Chinese), a second-year M.S. student at ShanghaiTech University (Shanghai, China), advised by Prof. [Yuyao Zhang](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/2020/0707/c7499a53859/page.htm). Before that, I received my B.E. degree at ShanghaiTech University in 2021.

I am interested in a variety of topics in <strong>computer vision</strong> and <strong>medical image processing</strong>. My current research focuses include: <br>
* Implicit neural representation; <br>
* Brain atlases construction; <br>
* Self-supervised volume reconstruction; <br>
* Weakly/semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation (especially for fetal brain).
