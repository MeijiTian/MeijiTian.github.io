[Zihan Zheng](https://zhengzihan.com/) works on security and he knows many things. Not just because he is older than me :)

[Liwei Luo @ UCI](https://loliw.moe/) is a CS student who love daydreaming :). I have to mention that I really enjoy discussing Feminism with her!

[Ruomin Huang @ USTC](https://fockee.github.io/) is an elegant researcher, and I am pretty sure he would agree with this statement :)

[Beining Wu @ USTC](https://beiningwu7.github.io/) is hard-working on research. Good luck to his 2023 Fall application.

[Zhanghan Wang @ NYU](https://rabbitwhite1.github.io/) is a system PhD with Girl Friend. So good :(

[Wei Fan @ Upenn](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~luke2001/) is a Statistics PhD and hope people can [push his friends](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~luke2001/push.html) (e.g. me).

[Bowen Li @ CMU](https://jaraxxus-me.github.io/) is a Robotics PhD with many papers, too many compared with System PhD :(
