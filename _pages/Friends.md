[Liwei Luo @ UCI](https://loliw.moe/) is a CS student who love daydreaming :). I have to mention that I really enjoy discussing Feminism with her!

[Ruomin Huang @ USTC](https://fockee.github.io/) is an elegant researcher, and I am pretty sure he would agree with this statement :) Good luck to his 2023 Fall application.

[Beining Wu @ USTC](https://beiningwu7.github.io/) is hard-working on research. Good luck to his 2023 Fall application.

[Zhanghan Wang @ NYU](https://rabbitwhite1.github.io/) is a system PhD with Girlfriend. So good :(

[Zihan Zheng](https://zhengzihan.com/) works on security and he knows many things. Not just because he is older than me :)

[Wei Fan @ Upenn](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~luke2001/) is a Statistics PhD and hope people can [push his friends](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~luke2001/push.html) (e.g. me).

[Bowen Li @ CMU](https://jaraxxus-me.github.io/) is a Robotics PhD with many papers, too many compared with System PhD :(

[Yiwei Yuan @ USTC](https://yyw.moe/) is a totoro (joking) and he believes he is a research Trash (definitely not!)

[Zhengyang Geng @ CMU](https://gsunshine.github.io/) is a warm person to be friends with (especially when he avoids me to become the last one in Dominion games through becoming the last one himself), and I have to mention that he has a wife (!)

[Alec Sun @ CMU]() plays 'frisbee' w/o 'ultimate', so sad! And he keeps correcting my English speaking and writing, so sweet :) Hope his mandarin improves with me around.

[Keyu Tao @ USTC](https://www.taoky.moe/) is a great CS person and enjoys anime as well. Although [he doesn't like self-introduction](https://blog.taoky.moe/about/), I do this for him :) What an angel am I!!
