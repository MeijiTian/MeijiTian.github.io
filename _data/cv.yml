    - title: Longitudinal Brain Atlases Construction via implicit neural representation. 
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Existing longitudinal atlas construction methods averaged brain images on discrete time points independently, leading to temporal inconsistency issue.
    - title: Robust Self-supervised Volume Reconstruction for Fetal Brain MRI. 
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Proposed a learning-based self-supervised volume reconstruction technique, which overcomes challenges in fetal brain MRI studies caused by motion artifacts and slice misalignment.
        - Combined a comprehensive forward model and under-parameterized deep decoder structure to reduce network overfitting and image artifacts caused by slice misalignment and motion.
        - Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both simulated MRI from brain atlas and real clinical scanning fetus MR data.
    - title: Self-supervised Slice-to-Volume Registration Despite Fetal Motion. 
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Formulate the slice-to-volume (SVR) as a function that maps the input 2D thick slice and the target 3D volume to a rigid transformation matrix, to address the challenge of fetal motion.
        - Our method achieves high-accuracy SVR performance on severe motion-corrupted fetal MRI data with various in-plane resolutions and slice thicknesses.
    - title: Longitudinal Infant Brain MRI Segmentation. 
      year: 2021
      description:
        - Investigate different segmentation model designs and extend DenseNet to 3D volumetric data to to perform 3D volumetric segmentation.
        - The method achieves dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 90.325% of three brain tissues across five time points.

      description:
        - Propose a behavior recognition method based on meta-learning using WiFi channel state information(CSI).
        - Our method enables the model to rapidly adapt to new environments, as demonstrated through its performance on two public datasets and real-world data, in comparison to traditional supervised learning.
