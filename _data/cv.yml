    - title: Longitudinal Brain Atlases Construction via implicit neural representation. 
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Existing longitudinal atlas construction methods averaged brain images on discrete time points independently, leading to temporal inconsistency issue.
        - Modeled the time inconsistency issue as a 4D image denoising task, and use implicit neural representation to construct continuous and noise-free longitudinal brain atlases.
        - Evaluated on two modalities of brain atlases (QSM and fetus atlases), and significantly improves temporal consistency while maintaining accurate representation of brain structures.
        - Extended to generate finer (i.g. 0.5-week interval) 4D atlases with higher spatial and temporal resolution.
    - title: Robust Self-supervised Volume Reconstruction for Fetal Brain MRI. 
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Due to slice misalignment and motion artifacts, the fetal brain MRI reconstruction is often corrupted.
        - Combined a comprehensive forward model and under-parameterized deep decoder structure to reduce network overfitting and image artifacts caused by slice misalignment and motion.
        - Outperformed SOTA methods (SVRTK, NiftyMIC, and SSGNN) by achieving superior results across five matrices (i.g. 24$\%$ improvement in PSNR) on both simulated and real clinical data.
    - title: Self-supervised Slice-to-Volume Registration Despite Fetal Motion. 
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Slice-to-volume registration (SVR), which corrects the slice misalignment, is essential for subsequent 3D volume reconstruction.
        - Incorporated the MRI acquisition model into the SVR network to accurately predict the spatial transformation aligning 2D slices to 3D volumes.
        - Achieved better SVR performance (i.e. lower MAE and RMSE value), and benefited the existing fetal brain MRI reconstruction methods.
    - title: Longitudinal Infant Brain MRI Segmentation. 
      year: 2021
      description:
        - Investigate different segmentation model designs and extend DenseNet to 3D volumetric data to to perform 3D volumetric segmentation.
        - The method achieves dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 90.325% of three brain tissues across five time points.
