[Kinetic Modeling of Data Eviction in Cache](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc16/technical-sessions/presentation/hu)

## Abstract

- In this paper, we present a kinetic model of LRU cache memory, based on the **average eviction time (AET)** of the cached data.
- The AET model enables **fast measurement and low-cost sampling**.
- It can produce the miss ratio curve (MRC) in **linear time with extremely low space costs**.
- Furthermore, AET is a composable model that can characterize **shared cache behavior** through modeling individual programs.
