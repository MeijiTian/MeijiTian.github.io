[LAMA: Optimized Locality-aware Memory Allocation for Key-value Cache](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc15/technical-session/presentation/hu)

## Abstract

以前有 slab calcification 问题。

This paper introduces locality-aware memory allocation (LAMA), which solves the problem by first analyzing the locality of the Memcached requests and then repartitioning the memory to minimize the miss ratio and the average response time.
